Your task is to write a bash script which configures a Linux firewall using IPtables. In particular, it should be executed on the Kali VM given out for our earlier assignment to produce a lasting permanent change to the OS's firewall configuration. You should assume that the computer needs to be configured as a secure web server supporting http and https traffic, with remote ssh access for you. Further, you want ssh access limited to a particular static IP address (any will do). Connection tracking should be stateful, so that you are not leaving wide ranges ports unnecessarily open, either outgoing in incoming. Additionally, you should have secure defaults to reject all incoming and outgoing TCP and UDP traffic not necessary for the web server's above-stated functionality. The examples given in class contain valid firewall configuration options, but do not specify how to save or manage the configuration in a Debian-based operating system (Kali); you will need to do some internet research to determine the correct way to save the configuration. You should test your firewall configuration script on the Kali VM, and validate that it behaves as you expect, by using Wireshark to test outgoing traffic (easy) and if you can, incoming (slightly harder) connections, perhaps via nmap or other methods. Submit one bash script, with full sentence comments above each configuration command, describing what you are doing with EVERY line of of the configuration script.
